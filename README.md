# <span style="color:sandybrown"><b>Restart: an extension of Booksim 2.0, the Cycle accurate NoC simulator to host trace-like simulations.</b></span>

This is a simple extension of Booksim 2.0, the cycle accurate NoC simulator, to include the support for trace-like simulations. 
Booksim itself is an extremely flexible simulator: as the original authors of the code themselves specify, "most of the simulatorâ€™s components are designed to be modular so tasks such as adding a new routing algorithm, topology, or router microarchitecture should not require a complete redesign of the code".\
For these reasons, as well as the fact that the components of the simulated NoC are threated at a somewhat higher level of abstraction than other simulators, Booksim represents a good starting point for the main goal of this project.

## <b> 1.  <span style="color:sandybrown">Main objective of the code</b></span>

The primary goal is to implement a NoC simulator to use for processing application-specific workloads, in order to estimante the required resources - both in terms of power consumption and latency - for the correct and opimized execution of said application on a NoC-based architecture. The idea is to use the estimates produced by the simulation as data for optimization of the mapping of the application's tasks to the PEs represented by the nodes of the NoC

## <b> 2. <span style="color:sandybrown">Running the code </span> </b>

###  2.1.  How to compile
The code can be complied with the following comands, in the main directory of the project:
```bash

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make

``` 
To clean the build directory, use the following command:
```bash
$ make clean
```


# Interactive mode 
```python 
python install.py
```
# Create a new environment
```python 
python install.py --create-env --env-name renos --python-version 3.10
```
# Install in existing environment using conda
```python 
python install.py --env-name renos
```
# Install using pip in an existing environment
```python 
python install.py --env-name renos --use-pip
```
 
# Install using pip without conda
```python
python install.py --use-pip
```


steps to run the code
1. First create conda env with install.py and python3 = 3.11.11
